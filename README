cd build
../configure

```

You can also specify the installation prefix for the binary i.e., `../configure --prefix=/usr`, `../configure --prefix=/usr/local`.

## Install
To install, do

```

```
CTRL + q -> quit

Otherwise, type any other character to search for processes.

Do `sudo make uninstall` to uninstall.
